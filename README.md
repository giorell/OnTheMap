# OnTheMap

This is my first project for the 2nd semester of the Udacity iOS program. 

The goal of the app for a user is to post their location on the map with a name, and a website link. After registering, the pin would appear on the map. The app uses the Udacity API servers to GET and POST information. 

Previews made from iPhone X. 

The app contains the following view controllers:

1. Login Page
2. Home Map Page
3. Location Lists Page
4. Add Location Page
5. Find Location Page

#### LOGIN PAGE
The login page allows a user to login using their Udacity account information, calling the Udacity API.

#### HOME PAGE
The homepage shows all of the pins that were added by students. Each pin is clickable and takes you to the provided URL link.

#### ADD LOCATION PAGE
Users can add their location and a URL link to add to the database.

#### FIND LOCATION PAGE
The location from the previous input page is used to present a map pin and a button to confirm the location.
